streamserver
============

Here you can find the configuration for icecast2 as the master as well as a relay. In addition, there is a script for liquidsoap which manages a fallback if something goes wrong.

fallback
--------

Since Oleander changed the whole script, liquidsoap's input.harbour is used as the primary input. Please refer to fallback.liq for further information on how to use it.
